<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This is a page dedicated to information about me.  For starters, my name is Silamoth.  Well, that's my screenname anyways.  I am currently 16.  I'm currently a sophomore in high school.  As you can probably guess, I like computers and programming, which is part of the reason 
why I am making this website.  I also enjoy playing and making video games.  You can check out some of my projects here on this website.  I enjoy science and have a love-hate relationship with math.  I aspire to be a game developer.  I'm currently working
on <a href = "tower.html">Tower Conquest</a> (name to be changed), which will be the first game I actively promote.</p>
